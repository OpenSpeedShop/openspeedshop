osscompare \- Open|SpeedShop compare experiments script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.IP "osscompare "database_file, database_file [, database_file .... ] "
.fi

.SH TYPICAL USAGE FORM
.nf

osscompare "database_file, database_file" [ time, percent, <other metrics> ] 

For example:

osscompare "smg2000-pcsamp-64.openss, smg2000-pcsamp-128.openss"  percent
osscompare "smg2000-hwcsamp-1.openss, smg2000-hwcsamp-2.openss"  PAPI_L1_DCM

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B osscompare

osscompare is a convenience command script that invokes the 
Open|SpeedShop application level performance tool to compare 
multiple Open|SpeedShop database files to eachother.  A side-by-side
comparison report is generated from the database files that are specified.

Information that is presented after the execution of the osscompare
experiment is exclusive CPU time or optionally, percentage of time spent
in each function, for all the functions in the application across all the
database files specified on the command line. Other metrics are also available
depending on the experiment.  For the hardware counter sampling experiment 
(hwcsamp), the PAPI event name may be specified as the metric, for example:
PAPI_TOT_CYC or PAPI_L1_DCM.

Also, osscompare supports the "rows" option which limits the output to a
specific number of lines of output.  There is a "viewtype" option which allows
the comparison to be done using either function level, statement level, or
library (linkedobjects) level granuality.  Function level is the default.
The "oname" option lets the user name the output file names if the OPENSS_CREATE_CSV
environment variable is set.

.SH OPTIONS

osscompare "database_file, database_file" [ time, percent, <other metrics> ] [rows=nn] [viewtype=[functions|statements|linkedobjects]] [oname=<output filename>]

.IP " ""database file"" "
This option specifies a database file that was previously created with
Open|SpeedShop and is a valid database file.

At this time the limit for database files that can be specified on one
osscompare command is eight (8).

For example:

        "smg2000-pcsamp-64.openss, smg2000-pcsamp-128.openss" 

or

        "smg2000-pcsamp-64.openss, smg2000-pcsamp-128.openss, smg2000-pcsamp-256.openss" 

Open|SpeedShop requires quotes around the database files.

.IP """time"""
Compare by exclusive time.  This is the default.

.IP """percent"""
Compare by the percentage for the aggregated exclusive CPU time across all the functions 
in the application

.IP "-m metrics are allowed"
Any acceptable/valid metric (-m) expview option can be used to override the default values of time and percent.  This includes hardware counter values in the hwcsamp experiment.  For example, if you gathered data for a few counters, including PAPI_FP_OPS, you could specify: PAPI_FP_OPS as the comparison metric.  Or one could specify another of the other counter events.


.IP "rows=nn"
Limit the number of rows of comparison data output to a specific number, which will include 
the most significant differences.  The most significant differences will always be the first
few lines of the output.   So, setting rows=10 will give the top ten lines representing the most
significant variation output from the comparison.

.IP "viewtype=[functions|statements|linkedobjects]"

Specify the view granualarity.  Compare based on the function, statement, or library level.
Function level is the default.  So, by default the compare will be done comparing the performance
of functions in each of the databases.  If statments is specified then all the comparisons will
be made by looking at the performance of each statement in all the databases that are specified.
Similar for libraries, if linkedobject is selected as the viewtype parameter.

.IP "oname=<output file name>"

Specify the name of the comma separated list and compare text files which are created if the
OPENSS_CREATE_CSV environment is set.

.IP """<no arguments>"""
If no optional arguments are specified then the default comparison metric is exclusive
time.


.SH FILES
.IP ~/.qt/openspeedshoprc
.RS
The Open|SpeedShop preference configuration file which is 
accessed through the Open|SpeedShop GUI Preferences menu item.
This file contains several options which allow the user to 
configure Open|SpeedShop to better fit their needs.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP OPENSS_CREATE_CSV
This environment variable indicates to osscompare to create a
comparison file that contains the comparison output separated
by commas.  The name of the file will be the concatenated names 
of all the database files with a .csv suffix.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following diagnostics may be TBD:

.SH QUICK START EXAMPLE
In this example the two smg2000 application program counter sampling (pcsamp)
experiments will be compared to each other and a side-by-side report will be
generated.

.nf
osscompare "smg2000-pcsamp-4.openss, smg2000-pcsamp-5.openss" 

produces a report similar to this:

[openss]: Legend: -c 2 represents smg2000-pcsamp-4.openss
[openss]: Legend: -c 4 represents smg2000-pcsamp-5.openss

 -c 2, Exclusive CPU   -c 4, Exclusive CPU  Function (defining location)

.SH ADVANCED USAGE EXAMPLE
In this example the two smg2000 MPI application program counter sampling (pcsamp)
experiments will be compared to each other using the pcsamp metric threadaverage and 
in the second example, threadmax, to create a side-by-side report will be generated.
What this means is that the comparison will be made using the metric values across all the
MPI ranks for average in the first example and max in the second example.  
.nf
  osscompare "smg2000-pcsamp-2.openss,smg2000-pcsamp-2.openss" pcsamp::threadaverage rows=5
  osscompare "smg2000-pcsamp-2.openss,smg2000-pcsamp-2.openss" pcsamp::threadmax rows=5
