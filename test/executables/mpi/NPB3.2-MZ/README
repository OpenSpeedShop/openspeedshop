NAS Parallel Benchmarks 3.2, Multi-Zone Versions
-------------------------------------------------

For the description of the benchmarks, please refer to

   nas-03-010-abstract.html

The current distribution contains the following implementations:

   NPB3.2-MZ-SER:  a serial version
   NPB3.2-MZ-MPI:  a hybrid MPI + OpenMP version
   NPB3.2-MZ-SMP:  a hybrid SMP + OpenMP version

Version 3.2 includes two new classes of problem: E and F, to stress
very large parallel computer systems.  Class E is about 20 times as
large as Class D, and Class F is about 20 times as large as Class E.
