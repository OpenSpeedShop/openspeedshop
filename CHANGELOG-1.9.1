1) Fix mis-spelling in the Stats Panel regarding communicator metric settings which caused the communicator to not be available for display in the Stats Panel.

2) Fix misnamed mpit metric references in the GUI and support more optional metric names in mpit view.

3) Fix a mis-match in the default setting for less restrictive compares.  It is off by default, but it didn't honor the true setting until the preference was reset to true.

4) Remove import of tempfile.  Not currently used and is causing a runtime undefined error on ubuntu 8.10 (intrepid).
