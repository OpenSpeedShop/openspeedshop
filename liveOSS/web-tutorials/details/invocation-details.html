	<h2>Open|SpeedShop Invocation</h2>
	<b>Open|SpeedShop</b> will be invoked by the user typing the "openss" command. When the user invokes <b>Open|SpeedShop</b> command there are three options for its mode of operation:<br>

	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li><h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId171398"></a>openss -gui</h3></li>
		</ul>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This invocation of <b>Open|SpeedShop</b> causes the GUI to be raised then a command panel is also created. This command panel window becomes the interactive CLI window. Under this invocation <b>Open|SpeedShop</b> interactive commands can be entered into the Graphical User Interface's command panel and have the same effect as if they were entered under the "openss -cli" option.</div>
	
		<ul>
			<li><h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId654701"></a>openss -cli:</h3></li>
		</ul>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This invocation of <b>Open|SpeedShop</b> causes the window terminal becomes the interactive CLI window.</div>
	
		<ul>
			<li><h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId3287"></a>openss -batch:</h3></li>
		</ul>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This invocation of <b>Open|SpeedShop</b> will execute a performance experiment. specified by additional arguments, directly without user interaction. The -batch operation can be used in scripts and batch processing environments.<br></div>
       
      


        <ul>
            <li><h3><a class="mozTocH3"></a> openss -offline -f "executable and arguments"  experiment:</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

            This invocation of Open|SpeedShop will execute the command following the -f parameter.  
            The experiment type at the end is the collector used.  As this collection method utilizes LD_PRELOAD to intercept calls, 
            it must run during the entire execution time and will output files at the processor 
            level that are post processed to add to the experiment database.  <br><br>
            
            An important environment variable for this type of invocation is OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR.
            The OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR variable must be defined within the user's environment before 
            OpenSpeedShop is invoked. If the OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR environment variable is not defined in the user's 
            current terminal session before the invocation of OpenSpeedShop, 
            then all raw performance data files will be placed in /tmp/offline-oss 
            which is expected to be shared file space. <br><br>
            
            Either the -gui or -cli interface can be brought up to load the experiment data for further analysis. <br><br>

            <b>NOTE</b>: In general, it is best if a user selects a target directory 
            located where processor written files are best placed. <br><br>
            <b>WARNING</b>: Concurrent instances of OpenSpeedShop MUST have unique 
            OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR target values associated with each respective 
            OpenSpeedShop instance. Also make sure the target exists.
